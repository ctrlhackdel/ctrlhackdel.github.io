# CTRL+HACK+DEL Documentation
Created by [Kyle Truong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/truong-kyle/) based on [Araf A. Alam's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/araf821/) original repository
## About this Page
This site helps the future CHD teams and potentially other hackathons help to build their site and note what and what not to do.
This is built based on my (Kyle's) own leadership as the project manager during the development and iteration of v2.0.
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** CTRL+HACK+DEL 2.0 will be referred to in this document as "2025", as the original planned date was November, 2025. Due to logistics and poor planning, the date was later pushed to February, 2026.
